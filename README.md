# Mach One
My test bed for learning how to build a game in Zig using Mach.

# Motivation
I have always wanted to make a video game, but one that is playable everywhere. I believe that mach can achieve this - so I am setting out on the journey to learn, develop, and hopefully contribute to it as well.
